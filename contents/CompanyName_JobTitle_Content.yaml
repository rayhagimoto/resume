    #   based on size, shape, and aspect ratio.
    #   Integrated two Lambda functions: one for CV inference and one for secure upload handling via
    #   presigned S3 URLs.
    #   Used Tasker automation to upload compressed images from an Android device to S3, triggering detection.
    #   Connected a Telegram bot to push annotated image alerts in real time (within seconds).
    #   Gained experience in cloud-native CV deployment, event-driven architecture, and end-to-end ML
    #   pipeline robustness testing.

    location: ''
    dates: '2024'
    # description: >
    #   Built a containerized resume generation tool that compiles YAML-formatted resume content into
    #   a clean, ATS-compatible PDF using a LaTeX template and `latexmk`.
    #   Designed for cross-platform reproducibility and consistent rendering via a Dockerized build pipeline.
    #   Users define content modularly in YAML, enabling structured sections that can be swapped or extended;
    #   while not fully toggle-based, the layout supports flexible customization through LaTeX template editing.
    #   The system integrates a custom resume submodule for optimized formatting
    #   [rayhagimoto/resume](https://github.com/rayhagimoto/resume) and
    #   emphasizes build reproducibility, resume standardization, and developer-centric usability.
    #   Project showcases skills in containerized tool design, document automation, reproducible environments,
    #   and template-driven document generation for professional use cases.
